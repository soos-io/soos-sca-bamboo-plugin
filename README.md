### Configure authorization

**SOOS SCA Plugin** needs environment variables which are passed as parameters. These environment variables are stored by checking "Global variables" on administration (gear icon), and they are required for the task to operate.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SOOS_CLIENT_ID | Provided to you when subscribing to SOOS services. |
| SOOS_API_KEY | Provided to you when subscribing to SOOS services. |

These values can be found in the SOOS App under Integrate.

### Select the mode

#### Run and wait for the analysis report
Set the **Mode** parameter to *Run and wait*, then you can run the plans in your CI/CD, and wait for the scan to complete.

#### Start the Scan
Set the **Mode** parameter to *Async init*, if you don't care about the scan result in your CI/CD plan, this is all you have to do!

#### Wait for the Scan
If you care about the result or want to break the build when issues occur, add a second task close to the end of your plan to give the scan as much time as possible to complete, setting the **Mode** parameter to *Async result*.
